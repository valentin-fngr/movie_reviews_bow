    "# Classification de documents : prise en main des outils\n",
    "\n",
    "Le but de ce TP est de classer des documents textuels... Dans un premier temps, nous allons vérifier le bon fonctionnement des outils sur des données jouets puis appliquer les concepts sur des données réelles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conception de la chaine de traitement\n",
    "Pour rappel, une chaine de traitement de documents classique est composée des étapes suivantes:\n",
    "1. Lecture des données et importation\n",
    "    - Dans le cadre de nos TP, nous faisons l'hypothèse que le corpus tient en mémoire... Si ce n'est pas le cas, il faut alors ajouter des structures de données avec des buffers (*data-reader*), bien plus complexes à mettre en place.\n",
    "    - Le plus grand piège concerne l'encodage des données. Dans le TP... Pas (ou peu) de problème. Dans la vraie vie: il faut faire attention à toujours maitriser les formats d'entrée et de sortie.\n",
    "1. Traitement des données brutes paramétrique. Chaque traitement doit être activable ou desactivable + paramétrable si besoin.\n",
    "    - Enlever les informations *inutiles* : chiffre, ponctuations, majuscules, etc... <BR>\n",
    "    **L'utilité dépend de l'application!**\n",
    "    - Segmenter en mots (=*Tokenization*)\n",
    "    - Elimination des stop-words\n",
    "    - Stemming/lemmatisation (racinisation)\n",
    "    - Byte-pair encoding pour trouver les mots composés (e.g. Sorbonne Université, Ville de Paris, Premier Ministre, etc...)\n",
    "1. Traitement des données numériques\n",
    "    - Normalisation *term-frequency* / binarisation\n",
    "    - Normalisation *inverse document frequency*\n",
    "    - Elimination des mots rares, des mots trop fréquents\n",
    "    - Construction de critère de séparabilité pour éliminer des mots etc...\n",
    "1. Apprentissage d'un classifieur\n",
    "    - Choix du type de classifieur\n",
    "    - Réglage des paramètres du classifieur (régularisation, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploitation de la chaine de traitement\n",
    "\n",
    "On appelle cette étape la réalisation d'une campagne d'expériences: c'est le point clé que nous voulons traviller en TAL cette année.\n",
    "1. Il est impossible de tester toutes les combinaisons par rapport aux propositions ci-dessus... Il faut donc en éliminer un certain nombre.\n",
    "    - En discutant avec les experts métiers\n",
    "    - En faisant des tests préliminaires\n",
    "1. Après ce premier filtrage, il faut:\n",
    "    - Choisir une évaluation fiable et pas trop lente (validation croisée, leave-one-out, split apprentissage/test simple)\n",
    "    - Lancer des expériences en grand\n",
    "        - = *grid-search*\n",
    "        - parallèliser sur plusieurs machines\n",
    "        - savoir lancer sur un serveur et se déconnecter\n",
    "1. Collecter et analyser les résultats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inférence\n",
    "\n",
    "L'inférence est ensuite très classique: la chaine de traitement optimale est apte à traiter de nouveaux documents\n",

      "what's the deal ? \n",
      "watch the movie and \" sorta \" find out . . . \n",
      "critique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \n",
      "which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly . \n",
      "they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \n",
      "so what are the problems with the movie ? \n",
      "well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled . \n",
      "it starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on . \n",
      "there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \n",
      "now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem . \n",
      "it's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \n",
      "and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \n",
      "not really . \n",
      "the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . \n",
      "i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \n",
      "i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \n",
      "okay , we get it . . . there \n",
      "are people chasing her and we don't know who they are . \n",
      "do we really need to see it over and over again ? \n",
      "how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \n",
      "apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \n",
      "there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \n",
      "the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \n",
      "but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . \n",
      "overall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \n",
      "oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it's \n",
      "just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \n",

      "we root for the captive of the cage-world . \n",
      "our protagonist is counting on \" chaos theory \" to help him escape his elaborate trap . \n",
      "the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . \n",
      "although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them . \n",
      "it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them . \n",
      "i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show . \n",
      "carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing . \n",
      "earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . \n",
      "the two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn't see it that way . \n",
      "perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . \n",
      "but on its own terms , the movie is well made . \n",
      "sight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . \n",

      "one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . \n",

      "the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman's world is still beautiful and perfect . \n",
      "when the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . \n",
      "philip glass' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman's scenes of suspicion and awakening . \n",
      " ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) \n",
      "and the pacing of the story was brisk . \n",
      "there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . \n",
      "one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn't necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . \n",
      "there's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . \n",
      "it's a quick , straight shot to the movie's end . \n",
      "in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . \n",
      "both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . \n",

      "['jamaica is a hot vacation spot . \\nthe exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth ( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american ) , the sea is a brilliant blue , the air is warm but lacks humidity . \\nand as tourism is unfortunately jamaica\\'s biggest trade , foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation . \\nlife and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country . \\nwhile normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music , this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface . \\nthe voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid . \\nit guides the audience along a tourist\\'s journey and the story of the native inhabitants . \\ninstead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , \" you don\\'t see what happens after you flush the toilet . \" \\nthis engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there . \\nthis strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film . \\nstephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals . \\nthis isn\\'t just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life . \\npeople are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country . \\nthe variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not . \\nof course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank . \\nofficials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica\\'s economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word . \\nthe next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u . s . is forcing on the citizens . \\nadmittedly , some of the back and forth between the business-minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument . \\nbut jamaica isn\\'t against the united states , and this documentary does not accuse the u . s . of being the sole perpetrator of its grief . \\nif anything , it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations . \\n'\n",
      " \"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . \\nwe hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves . \\nwithout an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye . \\neven without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . \\nbut do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? \\nexploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . \\nis the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? \\nmidnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . \\nas joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . \\nduring the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . ' \\nas joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . ' \\na troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . \\nhaving adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . \\njoe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . \\nhe romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . \\nby the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . \\njust as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . \\nbut how realistic are these ideals ? \\njoe had raped and been raped in texas . \\nthe scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . \\nalongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . \\nthe ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . \\nschlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . \\nwe understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . \\nhe runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . \\nin the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . \\nstanding up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . \\nschlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . \\nbeyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison . \\nthe fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation . \\nit is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . \\njoe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . ' \\nthere are two predominant images of new york . \\nthe first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . \\nthe other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . \\njoe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . \\nmirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . \\njoe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . \\nthe people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . \\nwhat has become of joe's american dream ? \\nschlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . \\njoe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . \\nat the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . \\ncontrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence . \\nthere is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . \\nthe party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals . \\njoe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils . \\nthe american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . \\nas joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . \\nhis masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . \\nfor joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . \\ntossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . \\nthe final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . \\ninstead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . \\nreflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice . \\nthe scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . \\nthe world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . \\nno longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . \\nmidnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . \\nthere is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . \\nthen there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . \\njoe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . \\nduring his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . \\nan allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons . \\n\"\n",

! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \\nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he\\'s nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn\\'s batman . \\nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \\nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness\\' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \\nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that\\'s one of the problems with this film . \\ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i\\'ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \\nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn\\'t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn\\'t bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \\nfor example , one of the film\\'s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \\nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader\\'s master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \\nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \\na lot of the movie is like that . \\nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it\\'s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience\\'s pre-existing fondness for them . . . \\nbecause he doesn\\'t do much to add to it in any way . \\nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn\\'t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \\neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia\\'s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \\nwhat\\'s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \\nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \\nthere\\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \\nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \\ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \\nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \\nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you\\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \\nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \\noddly , this isn\\'t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \\nwell , he\\'s done a good job . \\nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \\nthat\\'s not jake lloyd\\'s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \\nthat\\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \\nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \\nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin\\'s future evil in the film . \\nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there\\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \\nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \\nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn\\'t all hearts and roses is yoda\\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \\nhis explanation ? \\n \" his future is clouded . \" \\n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \\nenter at your own risk . ) \\nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \\nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \\nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon\\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \\nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \\ndid this story need to be told ? \\ni would say no . \\nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \\nabsolutely . \\nif you don\\'t enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \\nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \\nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \\nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \\nabove all , this is a fun movie . \\nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \\nbut fun . \\nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \\nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \\n : ) \\n'\n",

      " 'only a year after the initial release of \" scream , \" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel \" scream 2 \" has arrived in our theaters . \\nwhile the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it\\'s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . \\nthe first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . \\nthe premise of \" scream 2 \" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called \" stab , \" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in \" scream , \" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . \\ni had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . \\nits conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it\\'s a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . \\nthe satire in \" scream 2 \" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . \\nalthough resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . \\neverything from \" friends \" and \" saved by the bell \" to \" showgirls \" and \" terminator 2 \" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren\\'t any \" wes carpenter \" jokes this time . \\nmore importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . \\nthe killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from \" scream \" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine\\'s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . \\nunderstandably , \" scream 2 \" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . \\ncouple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . \\nwe don\\'t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . \\nwhile i have not seen any of his other work , it\\'s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated \" slasher film \" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . \\nunfortunately , \" scream 2 \" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . \\nfor example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . \\nthere are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . \\nas for the question of whether or not \" scream 2 \" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , it\\'s hard to say . \\ni gave the first \" scream \" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . \\n \" scream 2 \" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . \\ni\\'m not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck . \\n'\n",

\\nand that they killed people so disgustingly ? \\nand wouldn\\'t it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it\\'s so blatantly real bad porn that i\\'ve completely convinced myself that it\\'s not . \\ni mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up . \\nand it\\'s not just that it\\'s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it\\'s that in a film where the entire feel it\\'s going for isn\\'t felt , it\\'s also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time . \\nthe sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this . \\nbut that doesn\\'t matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark . \\nthe camera operation is also the worst i\\'ve ever seen in my entire life . \\nnot only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus . \\nthe editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow . \\nthere is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it\\'s \" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ?

      " 'film adaptation of hunter s . thompson\\'s infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . \\ndirector terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) \\n \" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie \" , according to gilliam . \\nplot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . \\nduring their trip , they systematically consume \" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . \\nthe movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . \\ncritique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer\\'s own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . \\nif you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . \\nif , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture\\'s entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . \\nnote : i have not read thompson\\'s book . \\nhaving said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . \\nthis movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . \\nit moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . \\nit was 1971 , and the times were apparently \" a\\' changing \" in the states . \\njohnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . \\nduring the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . \\ni thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . \\nthe one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . \\ni couldn\\'t believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \\nword on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . \\nplenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . \\nother than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . \\nthis movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . \\nand for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . \\nlittle known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . \\nbill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . \\njohnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what\\'s eating gilbert grape ? \\n ( 7/10 ) . \\nin 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he\\'d tried every drug by the age of 14 . \\njohnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now . \\njohnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself \" mr . stench \" , has been engaged to four women until now ( including actress winona ryder , whose \" winona forever \" tattoo had to be altered to \" wino forever \" after their breakup ) , currently plays guitar in a band called \" p \" , and owns the viper room nightclub in l . a . \\n'\n",
      " ' \" the blair witch project \" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . \\nits success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . \\nafter the release of \" the blair witch project \" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . \\nlocals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , \" get out of these woods and go home ! \\nthere is no goddamned blair witch ! \" . \\njeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . \\nafter he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . \\nas the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the \" blair witch hunt \" . \\namong the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called \" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? \" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . \\nthe last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying \" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . \" \\nthis strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . \\non the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr\\'s abandoned house , strange things start happening . \\nwhen they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . \\nafter a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . \\nthey are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . \\nthey are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality . \\nthe only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . . \\ndocumentary director joe berlinger ( \" paradice lost \" ) helms \" blair witch 2 \" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . \\nthe opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . \\nbut soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . \\nin a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . \\nmore money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . \\nthe horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . \\nof course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . \\nfrom its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell\\'s ( \" being john malkovich \" and \" fargo \" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with \" the blair witch project \" . \\n \" blair witch . . \" \\nwas filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . \\nin the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . \\nwith its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . \\nand though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . \\nthe key is simplicity . \\n \" blair witch project \" had a story which was incredibly simple . \\nthat allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination . \\nthe film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . \\nthe effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way . \\n \" book of shadows \" feels incredibly controlled and restrict . \\nhere , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and \" clever \" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it . \\nthere is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with . \\nthis is simply a less artistic film that doesn\\'t have the talent and originality of its predecessor . \\nit resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn\\'t always succeed . \\nbut most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn\\'t allow it to destroy the original . \\nin the end , i can\\'t call it a bad effort . \\nit\\'s less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad . \\nit\\'s simply different . \\nin fact , if you haven\\'t seen \" the blair witch project \" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between \" the blair witch project \" and the \" scream \" -films . \\nthe only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . \\nbut it\\'s a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . \\nto me the story of \" the blair witch project \" seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that \" the book of shadows \" is certainly assured . \\nand it\\'s already time to look forward to \" blair witch 3 \" . \\n'\n",

    "Le problème est dur mais fréquent; les solutions sont multiples mais on peut isoler 3 grandes familles de solution.\n",

    "1. Ré-équilibrer le jeu de données: supprimer des données dans la classe majoritaire et/ou sur-échantilloner la classe minoritaire.<BR>\n",

    "1. Courbe ROC et modification du biais. Une fois la fonction $\\hat y = f(x)$ apprise, il est possible de la *bidouiller* a posteriori: si toutes les prédictions $\\hat y$ sont dans une classe, on va introduire $b$ dans $\\hat y = f(x) + b$ et le faire varier jusqu'à ce qu'un des points change de classe. On peut ensuite aller de plus en plus loin.\n",
